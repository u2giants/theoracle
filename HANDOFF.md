# HANDOFF

Active handoffs live in [`HANDOFF.d/`](HANDOFF.d/) — one write-once file per AI
session, named `<UTC-timestamp>-<machine>-<agent>-<slug>.md`.

**Starting a session:** list `HANDOFF.d/`, read the open files **newest first**.
Every file present is an OPEN workstream; finished ones are deleted (git history
keeps the text).

**Ending a session:** create your OWN new file in `HANDOFF.d/` following the
handoff standard (all 9 sections). **Do not rewrite this file, and do not edit
another session's file.** Concurrent sessions rely on that.
